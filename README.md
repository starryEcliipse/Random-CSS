# Random-CSS
Hello!! This repo contains html and css that I made when I was bored.  
The css is very PINK.  

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RANDOM PPL WHO WANT TO SEE THIS IN THEIR BROWSER:

1. Download both the css and the html files and save both to your computer **in the same folder.**
2. Open your fav web browser (works best w/ chrome imo).
3. Drag on drop the html into the browser window to open.  
4. Your browser is window is now pink.
