# Random-CSS
Hello!! This repo contains html and css that I made when I was bored.  
The css is very PINK.  

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE THIS IN THEIR BROWSER:

1. Download both the css and the html files and save both to your computer **in the same folder.** (Or copy paste the code  into separate text files, **one file for the html, one for the css**. Whatever works. If you do this, save the html text as a **.html file** and the css as a **.css file**.
2. Open your fav web browser (works best w/ chrome imo).
3. Drag on drop the html into the browser window to open.  
4. Your browser is window is now pink.  


See the [preview screenshot](https://github.com/starryEcliipse/Random-CSS/blob/master/CSS%20Preview.png) for an idea of how it will look (stuff appears more centered in the actual browser window).
